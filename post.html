		<h3>GFX Artist.</h3>

		<p>I started this career in around late 2020, i have managed to make over 10+ clients be on time with the wright GFX art.
		<br>
		<br>
		This was started due to lack of GFX artists making art for cheap, So i learnt how to make GFX and sell it for cheap *everything custom*
		<br>
		<br>
		GFX was made and sent straight to clients to make them happy, No stopping me.
		<br>
		<br>
		Clients have the ablity to test the GFX art work before bying this how they know if it is worth buying..
		<br>
		<br>
		I still work on GFX today!</p>
